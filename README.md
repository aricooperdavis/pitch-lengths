# pitch-lengths
The pitch-lengths project intends to make rope buying decisions easier for those interested in SRT caving in the UK. Its central aim is the creation of a .csv file containing required rope lengths for caves across the country, and the statistical analysis of this data to inform rope buying for clubs.
